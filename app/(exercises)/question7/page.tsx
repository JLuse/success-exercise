      <p>I really enjoyed the format of the excerise building out the responses using nextjs. The format and instructions are fairly straight forward, so I think one of the few areas I could think for improvement would be to highlight that most if not all the responses can be found in Vercel and nextjs documentation. This could help save some time going through google for example.  </p>
