      <p>A recent challenge we faced with my current team at Sentry, was a beta release for a new Cron job monitoring product. Due to the product being in beta, the engineering team was still working out much of the functionality constantly, so it was an ever-changing situation. This was a major challenge as I could not properly answer certain Crons questions for customers. Being a more experienced member of the support team, I took it upon myself to try and bridge a gap we had with the Crons team to suggest the support team sit in on stand-ups, for us to share the challenges we hear from customerâ€™s. This suggestion was taken positively and led to specific channels being created for the support and Crons team, as well the engineers being more involved with these support cases. Essentially, the direct line of communication and expressing the challenges was what helped the team take a more empathetic approach in helping us ultimately assist more customers.</p>
