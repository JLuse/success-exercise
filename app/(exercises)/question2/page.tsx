      <h2 className="underline">How would you compare Next.js with another framework? Feel free to compare with a framework of your choice.</h2>
      <br/>
      <p className="">Next.js compared to other frameworks comes down to it&apos;s simplicity. I find it lightweight/flexible, easily deployable, and the Vercel ecosystem is great. When you need to introduce a specific thing, there seems to always be a package available. A personal favorite of mine is how simple the file system based routing can be used, without the need to manually define routes and their corresponding handlers. Angular on the other hand feels a bit more opinionated than Next.js, with the need to follow specific Angular concepts. It does however have a wide range of features that are excellent if you&apos;re going to use them. If not, you end up with a lot of extra code you don&apos;t need, which slows down development flow.</p>
